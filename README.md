This map shows current data for your current location! The map finds your coordiantes, displays a blue circle to where you are. 
Then you can add a marker, answer prompts and boom! A marker with the relevant information is created. 

This tool is meant to serve seafarers, by building a "social platform" that also displays scientifically relevant information for each location. 

The files are seperated as: 

static
  markers.json
  uploads
  styles.css
  index.js

templates
  maps.html

app.py

Please run the flask to see how this works :)
