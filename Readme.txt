Welcome to our prototype!  

This tool is designed to display weather data, dust data, and wildfire smoke data at locations where sample flasks were collected.  

How to use the map:
1. Open the `ship_samples_lat_lon.xlsx` file.  
2. Identify the coordinates you wish to explore.  
3. Open `map.html` and launch it using a live server.  
4. Enter the selected coordinates into the map interface.  

Once the coordinates are entered, the map will display the relevant data for your chosen location.  

This prototype aims to simplify the visualization of environmental data linked to specific sampling points, 
making it easier to analyze patterns and insights from collected samples. If you encounter any issues, please review the instructions or ensure your live server is correctly set up.
